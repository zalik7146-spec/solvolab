# Privacy Policy (PowerPlace)

PowerPlace stores your data locally on your device by default. This includes diary entries, notes, tasks, focus sessions, and preferences such as your mood and theme.

- No analytics or tracking is included by default.
- AI requests (if enabled) are sent to your configured AI provider and may include your prompts/messages. Do not share sensitive information unless you are comfortable with your provider's policies.
- Calendar access is used only to create events you request and requires your explicit permission.
- Notifications (if enabled) are used only for reminders and focus timer alerts.

You may delete your data at any time by removing the app or using the in-app reset option (if present). If you enable cloud sync or third-party providers, their respective privacy policies apply.
